            <h2>my story </h2>
            <p>
            I am motivated to become a Software Engineer because I want a career I can be proud of and a job that inspires creativity. Although I have had many successes managing teams with different companies, I have not felt passionate about my line of work. After watching an interview with Melinda Gates, I felt encouraged to re-engage in researching opportunities in tech. I quickly discovered there are many available positions and many paths to join this vast and growing industry, including immersive bootcamps. Immediately, I was overwhelmed with all of the different possibilities available to me in the tech industry. I decided it was time to take a bootcamp prep course for myself and explore if Software Engineering was a viable profession for me. After completing the course, I determined that I have the potential to be a Software Engineer and I want to continue learning the programming skills. Maya Angelou once said “You can only become truly accomplished at something you love.” I firmly believe I will love this career and I will make my mark on this industry.
